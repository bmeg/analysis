      "GeneOntologyTerm:GO:0000724 The error-free repair of a double-strand break in DNA in which the broken DNA molecule is repaired using homologous sequences. A strand in the broken DNA searches for a homologous region in an intact chromosome to serve as the template for DNA synthesis. The restoration of two intact DNA molecules results in the exchange, reciprocal or nonreciprocal, of genetic material between the intact DNA molecule and the broken DNA molecule.\n",
      "GeneOntologyTerm:GO:0003713 A protein or a member of a complex that interacts specifically and non-covalently with a DNA-bound DNA-binding transcription factor to activate the transcription of specific genes. Coactivators often act by altering chromatin structure and modifications. For example, one class of transcription coregulators modifies chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones. A second ATP-dependent class modifies the conformation of chromatin. Another type of coregulator activity is the bridging of a DNA-binding transcription factor to the basal transcription machinery. The Mediator complex, which bridges transcription factors and RNA polymerase, is also a transcription coactivator.\n",
